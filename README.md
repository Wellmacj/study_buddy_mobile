# Project Title: Study Buddy 

## Team Members:

- Cage Wellman (developer and framework technician)
- Evan Schmidt (Quality Assurance analyst and Developer)
- Andrew Sellars (UI designer and developer) 

## Problem Statement:

Our app would allow students to track study times and assignments, which would allow them to balance their responsibilities by dedicating time to classwork and relaxing alike. We are trying to help people who have harder times balancing their school, work and home life and to help give them structure. This would also help procrastinating students or those who fall behind. 

## Target Audience: 

The primary audience is students who aim to stay on top of both their home and school life. It helps them by dedicating time to doing specific things rather than just letting them pile up. 

## App Features:  

- Calendar 
- To-Do list 
- “Study buzzer” In-built timer for studying 
- Study tracker, to determine what the best length of study time is for you to be productive 
- Canvas submitting system – a way to link assignments done through study buddy to have them automatically submitted properly. 
- Technology Stack: We would like to use .NET MAUI as our framework for this project. Possibly using a database framework (MYSQL) as a way to store data and access it readily. 

## Project Timeline:  

- Week 1 (6/29-7/5): Complete Framework / Skeleton Code 
- Week 2 (7/6-7/12): Complete Canvas Submitting System 
- Week 3(7/13-7/19): Complete Calendar Page 
- Week 4(7/20-7/26): Complete To-Do List and Timer Page 
- Week 5(7/27-8/2): Complete Study Tracker Page 
- Week 6(8/3-8/7): Finish Project for submission 

## Expected Outcomes: 

We want to have a bare-bones version of this app, with an installed calendar to track activities. Possibly a timer to track study time and the to-do list built. 

## Challenges: 

The only current challenge that we are thinking is that our work schedules may not line up much for us to be able to work together.
